# Models Directory

This directory stores trained machine learning models generated locally.

- Models are **not versioned in Git**
- All models are **reproducible from code**
- Training scripts and configs live in `src/` and in `notebooks/`

If you need a model:
1. Run the training pipeline
2. Artifacts will be saved here

For reproducibility details, see the project README.
